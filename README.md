# Plot Master

Plot Master is a full-stack application which enables users to plan and visualize garden plots.
Users are able to create plots of custom dimensions, populate these plots with their choice of plants, save plots to their user profile, and edit or delete their plots. 
Users also may view a custom-generated chart of all plants in their plot along with planting and harvesting timelines.
